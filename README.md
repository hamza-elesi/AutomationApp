## Description

The Automated GUI Script Runner is a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to automate interactions with other applications or processes running on their computer. It is designed to simplify and streamline repetitive tasks that involve clicking, scrolling, and moving the mouse pointer.

## Installation

To run this application, follow these steps:

1. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file to a directory on your computer.
2. Double-click the executable file (e.g., `Last.exe`) to run the application.
3. Enter the positions for example : (x=500,y=600)

## Usage

The application provides a simple interface where users can add client positions and define actions to be performed on those positions. It can be especially useful for scenarios where repetitive tasks are performed within Java applications, and automation can save time and reduce manual effort.


## Dependencies

This application relies on the following Python libraries and packages:

- `time`
- `psutil`
- `pyautogui`
- `tkinter`
- `logging`

These dependencies are bundled with the standalone executable, so you don't need to install them separately.
